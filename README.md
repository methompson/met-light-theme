# Mat's Light Theme
## VS Code Color Theme for Mat

This theme is based on my customization of VS Code's Light+ Theme. Most of the theme is intact, with a few color tweaks here and there.

Installation is easy. Navigate to `~/.vscode/extensions` and copy the contents of this repo into that folder. Restart VS Code or select `Reload Window` from the Command Palette and the theme should appear in your Color themes section.
